You are helping me build a 3D surf-foiling browser game. Before doing anything, read the `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` file in the project root — it contains the full tech stack, architecture, physics breakdown, design decisions, and lessons learned from previous attempts.

The game is at: `Surf-Foil-Game-Test/`

Key things to know upfront:
- The entire working game is in `src/App.tsx` (~303 lines). That's the source of truth.
- Run with `npm run dev` (http://localhost:3000, hot-reloads instantly)
- Type-check with `npm run lint` (tsc --noEmit)
- The existing foil physics feel good — don't replace them, build on top of them
- Make changes incrementally — one feature at a time, test after each change
- There are unused files in `src/components/` and `src/systems/` from a previous wave attempt. They are NOT imported. You can reference them for ideas or delete them.
